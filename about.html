            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p><strong>Personality Type:</strong> 'Tactile Empath' (creative), obsessive perfectionist, visual translator (strategist). Acts as the bridge between the client's messy ideas and final product, we manage expectations and ensure the design isn't just 'pretty' but actually solves a business problem.</p>
            <p><strong>Ikigai (Purpose):</strong> To transform a physical object into a recognizable, desirable brand. While many see it as just 'making things look pretty.'</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Passion:</strong> We don't just make boxes; we create the vessel for a brand's soul. Our passion is the 'wow' that happens before the product is even seen.</li>
                <li><strong>Vocation:</strong> To bridge the gap between creation and consumption.</li>
                <li><strong>Profession:</strong> Success is not measured by 'likes', but by conversion and durability.</li>
                <li><strong>Mission:</strong> To give small and large businesses the visual 'voice' they need to compete.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Hobbies:</strong> Reading novels, watching, exploring.</p>
